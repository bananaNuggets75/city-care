      <p>The International State College of the Philippines (ISCP) is a satirical and parodic Facebook page of a fictitious "international, extraterrestrial, and mythical university system" of the same name. It is a fictional institution created by Ni√±o Ged, which trended in the Philippines, the ISCP is known for its witty "course offerings" and online publicity materials that make it look like a legitimate higher education institution. The "university" is the home of the (nonexistent) Blue Aspins. Its adopted school hymn is the orchestral version of "Sun and Moon" by Anees.</p>

      <p>The satirical page features random personalities as "professors", "students", or "alumni". One of them is Filipino television host and weather forecaster Kim Atienza, who was "appointed" as the "dean of the College of Education". Atienza initially dismissed his association to the satirical "university" he first thought was a real institution of higher learning, and categorized it as a "scam" on August 6, 2022. Atienza, eventually, caught on to the trend and thanked ISCP for the "honor" of serving as its supposed educator. On his Twitter account, Atienza finally "accepted" the "appointment as Dean of Education", where he "required all students" to "submit" a "10-word reaction paper" on The Philippine Star article he "quote-tweeted".</p>
